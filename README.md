# 🏴‍☠️Agentics Repo of Repos (ar^2)

The idea is for a repo of repos containing projects created within the Agentics Foundation community. The hope is that this will foster increased collaboration and highlight potential opportunities.

## Initial thoughts
- Discord implementation primarily because this makes access control easier.
- Explicit dependencies mapped between repos.
- Automated analysis of projects identifies potential synergies/similarities, integration or re-use potential.
